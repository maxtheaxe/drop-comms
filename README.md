# pollen
a secure, decentralized messaging service that functions without any internet or mesh connection

## Inspiration

pollen was inspired by the many governments who continue to shut off the internet in times of dissent

## What it does

* messages propagate (securely) in the same way that bees pollinate flowers, over a network of nodes (run on raspberry pis in testing, but usable on any platform)

## Challenges I ran into

* sending messages over TCP sockets

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

* it is fully functional and theoretically legitimately usable in the real world, though I wouldn't endorse its security

## What I learned

* though I already knew this, I have a better appreciation of the unbelievable amount of precautions that must go into major encrypted messaging apps

## What's next for pollen.im

* compiled GUI releases for every major platform

## Extras
